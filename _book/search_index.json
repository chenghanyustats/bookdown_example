"],["about.html", "About 0.1 Usage 0.2 Render book 0.3 Preview book", " About Each R Markdown file must start immediately with the chapter title using the first-level heading, e.g., # Chapter Title. This is a sample book written in Markdown. You can use anything that Pandoc’s Markdown supports; for example, a math equation \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\). 0.1 Usage Each bookdown chapter is an .Rmd file, and each .Rmd file can contain one (and only one) chapter. A chapter must start with a first-level heading: # A good chapter, and can contain one (and only one) first-level heading. Use second-level and higher headings within chapters like: ## A short section or ### An even shorter section. The index.Rmd file is required, and is also your first book chapter. It will be the homepage when you render the book. 0.2 Render book You can render the HTML version of this example book without changing anything: Find the Build pane in the RStudio IDE, and Click on Build Book, then select your output format, or select “All formats” if you’d like to use multiple formats from the same book source files. Or build the book from the R console: bookdown::render_book() To render this example to PDF as a bookdown::pdf_book, you’ll need to install XeLaTeX. You are recommended to install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): https://yihui.org/tinytex/. 0.3 Preview book As you work, you may start a local server to live preview this HTML book. This preview will update as you edit the book when you save individual .Rmd files. You can start the server in a work session by using the RStudio add-in “Preview book,” or from the R console: bookdown::serve_book() "],["hello-bookdown.html", "Chapter 1 Hello bookdown 1.1 A section", " Chapter 1 Hello bookdown All chapters start with a first-level heading followed by your chapter title, like the line above. There should be only one first-level heading (#) per .Rmd file. 1.1 A section All chapter sections start with a second-level (##) or higher heading followed by your section title, like the sections above and below here. You can have as many as you want within a chapter. An unnumbered section Chapters and sections are numbered by default. To un-number a heading, add a {.unnumbered} or the shorter {-} at the end of the heading, like in this section.

It must be in a separate paragraph with empty lines above and below it. The paragraph must not be wrapped into multiple lines, and should not end with a white space. A normal paragraph. Define a text reference here. A scatterplot of the data cars using base R graphics. plot(cars) # a scatterplot Figure 2.1: Define a text reference here. 2.2 Chapters and sub-chapters There are two steps to cross-reference any heading: Label the heading: # Hello world {#nice-label}. Leave the label off if you like the automated heading generated based on your heading title: for example, # Hello world = # Hello world {#hello-world}. To label an un-numbered heading, use: # Hello world {-#nice-label} or {# Hello world .unnumbered}. Next, reference the labeled heading anywhere in the text using \\@ref(nice-label); for example, please see Chapter 2. If you prefer text as the link instead of a numbered reference use: any text you want can go here. 2.3 Captioned figures and tables Figures and tables with captions can also be cross-referenced from elsewhere in your book using \\@ref(fig:chunk-label) and \\@ref(tab:chunk-label), respectively. See Figure 2.2. par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) plot(pressure, type = &#39;b&#39;, pch = 19) Figure 2.2: Here is a nice figure!

Parts can be inserted at the top of an .Rmd file, before the first-level chapter heading in that same file. Add a numbered part: # (PART) Act one {-} (followed by # A chapter) Add an unnumbered part: # (PART\\*) Act one {-} (followed by # A chapter) Add an appendix as a special kind of un-numbered part: # (APPENDIX) Other stuff {-} (followed by # A chapter).

For example, we are using the bookdown package (Xie 2021) (check out the last code chunk in index.Rmd to see how this citation key was added) in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and knitr (Xie 2015) (this citation was added manually in an external file book.bib).

If you’d like to customize your 404 page instead of using the default, you may add either a _404.Rmd or _404.md file to your project root and use code and/or Markdown syntax. 6.3 Metadata for sharing Bookdown HTML books will provide HTML metadata for social sharing on platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn, using information you provide in the index.Rmd YAML. To setup, set the url for your book and the path to your cover-image file. Your book’s title and description are also used. This gitbook uses the same social sharing data across all chapters in your book- all links shared will look the same. Specify your book’s source repository on GitHub using the edit key under the configuration options in the _output.yml file, which allows users to suggest an edit by linking to a chapter’s source file.

The only difference is that there will be no search button on the single page output. You may also want to set the option split_by to none to only generate a single output page, in which case there will not be any navigation buttons.

The only argument of publish_book() that you may want to touch is render. It determines whether you want to render the book before publishing. If you have run render_book() before, you do not need to change this argument, otherwise you may set it to 'local' bookdown::publish_book(render = &#39;local&#39;) If you have set up your own RStudio Connect server, you can certainly publish the book to that server instead of bookdown.org. A.4.2 Netlify Drop Netlify (https://netlify.com) is a platform that offers cloud hosting and serverless backend services for static websites. Netlify offers both free and paid tiers for service, but they also offer a service called Netlify Drop (https://app.netlify.com/drop), which is a free publishing option that does not require a Netlify account to start. This option does not rely on your bookdown project being in a version-controlled repository. All you need is a bookdown project that you can build locally. A.4.2.1 The build-and-deploy pipeline sequence This publishing approach sets up the following flow of events: You start with a local bookdown project. You build your book locally to an output directory of choice (_book/ by default). You go to Netlify Drop (https://app.netlify.com/drop), and drag &amp; drop the output directory into the Netlify browser-based user interface. You make changes to your book, rebuild locally, then drag &amp; drop the output directory again into Netlify to update. The above is an overview—read on for step-by-step instructions. A.4.2.2 Before you begin Start with a local bookdown project. It does not need to be in GitHub or another version-controlled repository. If you do not have an existing book, you can create a simple bookdown HTML book to practice with instead. See Figure ?? for how to create a new book in RStudio, or use the function bookdown::create_gitbook() or bookdown::create_bs4_book() from your R console if you do not use RStudio. A.4.2.3 Build your book From your bookdown project, build your book locally using whichever method from Chapter ?? you prefer. A.4.2.4 Deploy your site Go to Netlify Drop (netlify.com/drop), where you should see a box that tells you to “Drag and drop your site folder here.” Next, drag and drop the output directory from your bookdown project (_book/ by default, unless you changed this in your _bookdown.yml file) into that box in your web browser. You should see your book deploy quickly with a random subdomain name of the form https://random-word-12345.netlify.com. You will also see a notice that unclaimed sites are deleted after 24 hours. You can sign up for a Netlify account to claim your site and keep it online permanently. A.4.2.5 Optional: Update your site After signing up for Netlify, you can update this kind of site, but it is a manual update. Go to Netlify.com and navigate to find your site, then click on “Deploys.” You should see a box as shown in Figure ??, indicating you may drag and drop your site folder to update your site (you may need to scroll to the bottom of this page). Navigate to your site’s landing page on Netlify.com (https://app.netlify.com), click on Overview &gt; Site Settings. Under Site information, click on Change site name and update it to a name that you want. If you want to use your own domain instead of Netlify’s subdomain, please read the documentation at https://docs.netlify.com/domains-https/custom-domains/. Note: Because every time you update your local version of the book, you need to manually upload the book to Netlify.
